## I would like to join this list. How can I help the project?

The best way to help the library is to look at the [open issues](https://github.com/noamgat/lm-format-enforcer/issues) and see if there is anything you can help with. If you have an idea for a new feature or a bug fix, please open an issue first to discuss it.

We are always looking to integrate into more inference frameworks. If you have a framework you would like to see supported, please open an issue and let us know.
